# Histopathologic Cancer Detection Project

This repository contains the code and analysis for the "Histopathologic Cancer Detection" Kaggle competition, submitted as a mini-project. The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model to identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans.

## Project Overview

This project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Inspecting and visualizing the dataset to understand its properties.
2.  **Model Development:** Building, training, and evaluating several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures.
3.  **Analysis:** Comparing model performance, tuning hyperparameters, and analyzing the effectiveness of different techniques like regularization and transfer learning.
4.  **Conclusion:** Summarizing the findings and discussing potential future improvements.

## Repository Contents

* `Cancer_Detection_Notebook.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, analysis, and discussion for this project.
* `submission.csv`: The final prediction file generated by the best-performing model for submission to Kaggle.
* `kaggle_screenshot.png`: A screenshot of the final standing on the Kaggle leaderboard.

## How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your-GitHub-Repo-URL]
    cd [Your-Repo-Name]
    ```
2.  **Download the data:** Download the dataset from the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection/data) and place the `train` and `test` image folders, along with `train_labels.csv`, in a `data/` directory.
3.  **Install dependencies:** The required libraries are listed at the top of the Jupyter Notebook. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
4.  **Run the notebook:** Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `Cancer_Detection_Notebook.ipynb`. You can then run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Final Model & Results

-   **Best Model Architecture:** [Briefly describe your best model, e.g., "A CNN with transfer learning using the VGG16 base."]
-   **Kaggle Score:** [Your final score, e.g., 0.95 AUC]
